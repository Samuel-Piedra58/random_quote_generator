# Random Quote Generator

The project is a Random Quote Generator. Each time the "Show another quote" button is clicked a new random quote will render to the page and the background color will change. The random quote generator will display a random quote on button click or when 20 seconds have passed. This project was built with vanilla JavaScript and utilized Web API's such as setTimout() and the DOM. Enjoy!
